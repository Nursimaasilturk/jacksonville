Website Template

Test Project

Please complete the following test project. You will find the test site PSD located in the "PSD" folder in the root directory. The file structure is very simple. All of our websites will follow a similar structure as presented in this test project. Please place the correct data into the corresponding files.

All of the fonts needed for this project are google fonts or create a new folder with name "Fonts" and use @font-face. 

Rules for making website:

    Please do not change the file struture or remove core markup that was added already.
    All text should remain text.
    Please create the website in a way where we would be able to add/remove/edit things easily.
    Please make all logos seperate layers. Which means the School name should be one layer and the background of the header a seperate layer.
    No Inline styles
    No IMG tags.

Requirements

    Please use Firefox to avoid cross-domain issues with template.
    When opening the index file you should see "Header - Area, Content - Area, Footer - Area".

Good luck and if you have any questions please feel to contact us.
